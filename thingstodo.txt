🎯 Dog Simulator Development Roadmap

🛒 Economy & Shopping
Add a shop system where players can buy items

Create valuable items: energy boosts, XP multipliers, special collars

Balance prices so money feels meaningful to earn


🎒 Inventory System
Implement inventory storage using JSON saving

Allow item usage from inventory during gameplay

Show equipped items that provide ongoing benefits


⚡ Progression Tuning
Adjust XP thresholds between ranks for better pacing

Add "XP to next rank" display so players see their progress

Balance action rewards - how much XP/money each action gives



💰 Money-Making Activities
Decide how dogs earn money: completing challenges, mini-games, daily quests?

Set money rewards: enough to feel rewarding but not too easy

Create money sinks: things players want to spend on



🎨 Polish & UX
Add more visual feedback for rank-ups and achievements


Add sound effects or more ASCII art for key actions



🌐 Online Features (Future)
Daily challenges pulled from GitHub

Leaderboards for top dogs

Update checking for new versions
