## ❓ Why did I make this?

In order to continue learning python I had to tackle classes head on. In my game you'll find a main class "Dog" with different methods which makes the dog do actions. Making a menu is a piece of cake but handling classes and methods like this is new to me and I found it as a good way to learn.
